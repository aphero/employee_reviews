rails new .
will create a new rails directory in the current folder instead of building a new directory.

Things that are happening:
Give me localhost:3000
  Router decides times#search
  times#search action does nothing
  search.html.erb is rendered
I see search form
I submit form to localhost:3000/times/results
  Router decides times#results
  times#results sets @selected_zone
  results.html.erb is rendered using the instance variable
I see rendered page

when using form_tag you have to switch your route to POST

if route is times/search you can use times_search_path behind form_tag to always refer to that route in views
