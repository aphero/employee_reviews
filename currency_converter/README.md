## The Idea

Create two classes that will handle currency conversions based on rates, amounts and currency codes that are given to them.

## How It Do

1. Create Currency objects that contain an amount of moneys and the currency code (or symbol) for said moneys.
2. Break down each object into a Float (I TRIED BigD and Int, I'M SORRY I JUST COULDN'T) and convert symbols to codes.
3. Allow the user to add, subtract, multiply and compare values of the same currency code.
4. Convert currency values between different currency codes.

## Things that could be improved upon

1. Use more accurate class types to store values.  Namely, BigD and Int.  
2. Add more methods to cover a wider variety of tasks.  Division being one example.
3. Not spending several days trying to convert between object classes when the project objective is much easier.
